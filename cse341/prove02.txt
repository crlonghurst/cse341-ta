1. Copy and paste the URL for your source code repository (e.g., GitHub):
https://github.com/crlonghurst/cse341-ta
3. Briefly list and describe the elements of the application that are functioning. 
Both views are working properly, one view has a form to allow for input, mine has 3
inputs that are then sent to the other page to display it. I am mostly finished with
having the data from the form put into a json file, and be displayed from that.
4. Briefly describe any pieces of the assignment that are not yet working correctly.
I got everything that was needed in the base completed, though while working on 
extra I got stuck. Meaning I was working on putting the information from the inputs
into a json file then getting read back in for displaying on the second view. I got
it partially done.
5. Briefly describe the "coolest" thing you learned while completing this assignment.
The coolest thing was learning how JSon objects work, and how I can read and 
write to a json file that was really cool.
6. If you could change this assignment to be more effective or helpful, what would you change?
I would give more information on how router and apps interact.
7. Please select the category you feel best describes your assignment:
   1 - Some attempt was made
   2 - Developing, but significantly deficient
   3 - Slightly deficient, but still mostly adequate
   4 - Meets requirements
   5 - Shows creativity and excels above and beyond requirements

4.5 

8. Provide a brief justification (1-2 sentences) for selecting that category.
In some ways I went above and beyond but other ways I wasn't quite there. 
For instance I was working on the reading and writing and displaying from a 
json file, but didn't get that done. While I got the page looking professional.
As well I was using EJS well.
